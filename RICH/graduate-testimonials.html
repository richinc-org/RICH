            &nbsp; &nbsp; My most valuable experience at RICH was the real-world experience I received in this
            internship.
            I had the chance to see what having a real job would be like and how to talk to people in a
            professional setting. Additionally, I was able to develop my Excel skills and become more proficient
            using the pla<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">tform. <em>What I Learned During My Remote Internship
                at the RICH Organization:</em>
              Reach Into Cultural Heights, Inc. (RICH) utilizes four principles to support their students
              and spurs them to respect not only themselves, but others as well. The four RICH principles are:
              I Matter, I Am Responsible for My Behavior, I Am Considerate of My Classmates, and I Use
              Thinking Strategies for School and Life Success. The program, Reach For Success, which was
              founded in 1991, guides students using these principles to reach their goals. Today RICH's
              digital platform offers the Reach For Success program using Google Classroom, where it
              provides cultural diversity projects and offers podcasts and video recordings to reinforce the 4
              RICH guiding principles. These principles that never lose importance, no matter if they were
              used in 1991 or 2021, are incredibly beneficial for the youth to grasp, blend into their daily lives,
              and continue to use even after leaving the program.
              <br><br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; Each RICH principle is important and useful for students. The principle I Matter teaches
              students resilience and reminds them to maintain a positive attitude. It is important for students
              to believe in themselves and retain a positive mindset when thinking of themselves or the goals
              and aspirations they have. If they constantly doubt themselves or don’t think they can succeed, it
              will bring down their self-esteem and motivation in school along with other aspects of their lives.
              I Am Responsible for My Behavior encourages students to put forth more effort in order to
              improve their self-management skills. It teaches them accountability and to “own up” to the
              consequences and results of their choices. Acknowledging where you went wrong or your part or
              contribution to an unfavorable outcome is the first step in decreasing the chances of it happening
              again. Additionally, I Am Considerate of My Classmates guides students to improve
              relationships with their peers and the people around them. This principle enables them to practice
              teamwork and be comfortable working with others. Lastly, the principle I Use Thinking
              Strategies for School and Life Success empowers students to cultivate achievable goals that
              demonstrate the learning styles that best fit them individually. Every student has different
              methods that most accurately work for them and allows them to absorb information in the most
              effective way.
              <br><br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; Although these principles were initially created in 1991, almost 30 years ago, they are
              just as important and effective now. One of the first graduates from the RICH program, Chrisann
              Anderson, conveyed how much the I Matter principle has helped her in many points of her life,
              “I was able to learn that ‘I matter’ and that statement has helped me along my journey from a
              young girl who faced challenges of finding herself, to a strong hard-working young individual
              who has remained humble and truly understands the importance of believing in myself. I used to
              have low self-esteem and struggle with expressing myself. But, now I am much more confident
              in myself and find myself encouraging others to believe in themselves and never think their
              words are unimportant” (Anderson, “First Graduates,” 2017). The principle I Matter helped to
              not only improve Chrisann’s self-esteem, but also her motivation and drive, as well as how she
              regards others. The use of the I Am Considerate of My Classmates principle is exemplified by
              Nadia Adram with, “This RICH program helped me because I made new friends, new
              connections with old friends, and stronger bonds” (Adram, “Graduate Testimonials,” 2016).
              <br><br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition to self-esteem and motivation, the 4 RICH guiding principles provenly betters
              previous
              relations with other students and pave the way for new relations to begin.
              Krystal contributes an instance that is both academic and social with the principle I Am
              Responsible for My Behavior, “This principle teaches me that I should always put a lot of effort
              into my work and always go higher than what you are supposed to do. This principle teaches me
              to always try my best. It also teaches me to never give up on my family and my future ahead”
              (Coskun, “Dear Cardiss Collins,” Spring 2014). This principle inspires students to put more
              effort and energy into their work to make it the best it can be. Ian Karim portrays how the I Use
              Thinking Strategies for School and Life Success principle has benefitted him in an academic
              setting, “I use the principles in school when I get stuck on a problem. I think of the R.I.C.H.
              principle ‘use thinking strategies for school and life success’ and I look at the charts that my
              teacher has that can help me answer the question. I use the acronyms like R.A.P.S and T.D.D.C.
              When I used these acronyms, it organized my response and I got full points on all my
              statements” (Karim, “Dear Alice Coachman,” Spring 2016). These principles assist students in
              remembering to use charts and think through the methods to answer questions instead of giving
              up if they have trouble with a question.
              <br><br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; All these examples have spanned over time from the early start of the program to now,
              nearly three decades later, and they all showcase the way in which the 4 RICH guiding principles
              uplift the young students in the Reach for Success program, leading them to live better lives.
              These principles are timeless and always leave a beneficial impact on the youth that learn and
              grow with them. They inspire children to believe in themselves, create and follow their goals,
              look out for their peers, and find accountability in what they do. These fundamental principles
              will continue to be an integral part of the RICH graduates’ lives and are important to instill in the
              new generations. They never cease to be effective or helpful, whether you’re in school, the
              workplace, or just your regular daily life.
              <br><br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; My internship with RICH has been a wonderful experience. I’ve been exposed to these
              four guiding principles that are now always in the back of my mind. After reading RICH
              students’ first-hand accounts on using these principles, I’ve seen them being used in a plethora of
              ways, and as a result, I have a better understanding of them. For instance, one student talked
              about their shift in understanding the principle I Matter from prioritizing mattering to others
              around them to mattering to themselves first, and I think that’s an important distinction. I Matter
              reminds you to put yourself first and keep in mind your worth. The principle I Use Thinking
              Strategies for School and Life Success has been very helpful in this internship when I was doing
              a task that I ran into some issues with. It reminded me to think of different ways to accomplish
              the task such as watching a YouTube video versus reading an article or using an app to find new
              ideas instead of relying on your thoughts alone. This principle will continue to be helpful when I
              start college in the Fall as well by further instilling the concept of determination and creativity in
              me when I may encounter obstacles in a project, paper, or any other aspect of college life.
              <br><br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; Furthermore, the principle I Am Responsible for My Behavior encourages me to continue
              my work and never give up. I’m responsible for a bad grade I may get on an assignment because
              I didn’t give my all, or I’m responsible for missing out on an opportunity because I didn’t submit
              something on time, and more. On a more positive note, I am responsible for and I should take
              pride in, the good work I’ve done, the new skills learned, and the money earned in this
              internship. Responsibility urges you to pay attention to the consequences or results of your
              actions, whether they are positive or negative. The principle I Am Considerate of My Classmates
              encourages me to always be kind to my peers and teachers.
              <br><br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; In these times we are all struggling, and if you’re put into a breakout room with your
              peers, you may be inclined to not talk to them,
              but even if it’s for a minute, you should. Other than family members, I don’t often speak verbally
              to my friends and it’s important that we talk to people and maybe ask them how their day was,
              because it may make their day and make them feel much better. This extends to teachers who
              mostly stare at blank screens full of names for the majority of their days. A simple good
              afternoon message in the chatbox, unmuting to speak to them, or even turning your camera on
              can make them, and your classmates feel much more comfortable.

            RICH’s "I matter" principle has allowed me to find confidence in both my business and in my personal life.
            I established my business in June 2020 and focus on creating luxury chocolate-covered strawberries fit for
            events and moments worth celebrating.
            My business started to take off, I was getting bookings for every day of the week. Creating smiles and
            memories with my work has shown me that not
            only was I feeding people's stomachs but I was feeding their hearts. Although "I matter" was something I
            always knew about myself, when I started
            to hear it from others in terms of my business, it was unbelievable how proud of myself I became. Keeping "I
            matter" in mind made it easier for me
            to grow healthier because I could never lose sight of what held significance: making sure I was keeping safe
            from covid, surrounding myself with
            positive people, and remembering my self-worth.

          <p>
            The RICH program has helped me a lot all throughout the year that I’ve been
            here and I hope it will do the same to others in the future. For example,
            when I first entered the doors of the RICH program, I was shy and very nervous
            for a reason that I can’t explain. However, as it’s the end of the year of the
            RICH program, I am very sad and feel like crying because I may not see Kayla and
            Dr. Dawson ever again. Although Imani has a Youtube channel, it won’t be the same
            as seeing them in person. But because of my wonderful mentors, I’m proud to say
            that I’m no longer shy and nervous around others. I’ll truly and deeply miss the
            RICH program and it’s ways in teaching me on how I matter.

          <p>
            I really like the “Reach for Success” program because it gives you confidence
            and I like working with my friends. It’s fun to share what we’re thinking. I
            also really love snack time. So I think it’s fun to go through the RICH program.

          <h1> Arlenis Hernandez, RICH Graduate </h1>

          <p>
            The Reach for Success program has helped me be more confident and believe in
            myself, despite how I bleak things seem. At times where I doubted myself, I was
            reminded of the RICH program and I picked myself back up. Without noticing it,
            I slowly gained the confidence in myself and I believed that I could. I would
            recommend others to the RICH program because it helped me tremendously, and without
            it, I would stay shy and insecure about my appearance and personality. Yet now,
            I’m not afraid to be me. The RICH program helped me be uncontrollably me.

          <p>
            The RICH program has helped in so many ways. It has made me more confident
            with my personal and school life. It has also helped me to get better grades. I love
            how the RICH program has benefited me my life. If I continue this program,
            it will help me a lot in middle school. To conclude, the RICH program has helped me so much.

          <h1>Kritika Lalli, RICH Graduate</h1>

          <p>
            RICH helped me understand how to use their principles in school and outside
            because it can show me how to be respectful to others and now I can use it in daily life I
            recommend the “Reach for Success” program because it is nice and I can
            learn a lot of things in a fun way, even when I get older. The program is nice and it is a good
            way to work on Saturday and learn something instead of being home and be bored.
            In conclusion, that is how the “Reach for Success” program is an amazing project.

          <h1>Sage Rajkumar, RICH Graduate</h1>

          <p>
            Before the RICH program, I was this person who was bad at writing, and
            didn’t believe that I could do well. The first day I came here I thought
            this wasn’t going to benefit me, but I got used to it and I kept it with me.
            My first semester I got all threes. A year later I got a four. Thanks to the
            reflective writing, it made me express myself and feelings and improved. So
            thank you RICH and Dr. Dawson.

          <p>
            This RICH program helped me because I made new friends, new connections
            with old friends, and stronger bonds. I’ve learned a lot of new things
            and I am happy to say that this program is very touching. Partnering with
            the Peace Run, I believe this program will make a large difference in the
            world. So as you can see, this program helped not only me, but all my friends
            and all those kids around the world.
