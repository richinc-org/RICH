          <h1> Dear Barbara Sizemore by Imani Kirlew </h1>
          <h4> Spring 2013 </h4>
          <p>
            Dear Barbara Sizemore,
            <br><br>
            My name is Imani Kirlew. Since my last name Kirlew, seems difficult for my friends to pronounce they call me
            Kurly Fries. I am 11 years old and in the sixth grade at Wheeler Avenue Elementary. My school goes from
            first graders to sixth grade. So the sixth graders are supposed to be an influence on the little ones. In
            school there is only one subject I love and it is math. Math to me is really fun and easy. I have been in
            the R.I.C.H Program for 2 years and it was a great experience, and with that great experience I learned four
            important principles. I learned I matter which means to believe in yourself, I am responsible for my
            behavior which means to have responsibility in my action, I am considerate of my classmates and others which
            means to help not only your friends and family but the people around you, last but not least the principle I
            use thinking strategies for school and life success which means to use what you learned in life and in
            school. This program helped me improve my grades and social life. Also, the program helped me gain a sense
            of responsibility and confidence in myself.
            <br><br>
            Barbara Sizemore I chose you for my NVLP project because I was inspired by your life. You were the first
            African American woman to head a public school system in a major city. Let’s start from the beginning. You
            were born on December17, 1927 in Chicago, Illinois to Sylvester and Delila Lafoon and have six siblings. At
            the age of eight, your father died in a terrible car accident and your mother remarried another man. After
            your mother remarried, your family moved to Evanston. When you were in both elementary and middle school,
            your schools were segregated, but you still got the best education ever. Since there weren’t any child abuse
            laws, you would have gotten beaten with a whip by your mother or teachers if you did something wrong in
            school or at home.
            <br><br>
            In 1944, you enrolled in Northwestern University and graduated with a degree in classical language in 1947.
            As you got older you became a teacher in Chicago’s public schools. In 1954, you earned an M.A. in elementary
            education from Northwestern. You stopped teaching in 1963 to become the first black female to be appointed
            principal of a Chicago school. In 1965, you became principal of Forestville High School and initiated
            efforts to turn the school from a bad place with boys in gangs and smokers into a great educated high
            school.
            <br><br>
            Since you did a great job educating many students, you were elected superintendent for the District of
            Columbia Public School System. That was the first time an African-American has been elected as
            superintendent in a school system in a major U.S city. Your educational views challenged many people, and
            with that challenge you had to face a hard time. You were fired in 1975.After that tragic incident you wrote
            a book called “The Ruptured Diamond” that explained everything that happened in Washington at the school and
            in your life. After you moved out of Washington you started teaching at University of Pittsburgh and worked
            with African American children.
            <br><br>
            In 1992, you assumed a professorship at DePaul University in Chicago. As the dean of School of Education,
            you created the School Achievement Structure program. That program started to spread around the country then
            around the world. The program was a very successful program to many people. As your journey ended you
            advised the Chicago public school system and kept on speaking and writing on many things. Barbara Sizemore,
            you died on June of 2004 and was a mother of six children and seven grandchildren.
            <br><br>
            As I said in the beginning of the essay, I learned four R.I.C.H principles that helps in everyday life and
            they are I matter, I am responsible for my behavior, I will be considerate for my classmates and others, and
            last but not least I use thinking strategies for school and life success. These principles helped me in life
            and the one that helped me the most is I matter. I matter helped me gain confidence and believe in myself.
            It also helped me to speak up and ignore people who bother me or who just don’t like me for some reason. But
            most importantly I matter helped me gain confidence in myself. Before I came into the RICH Program I was
            afraid of my own shadow; I wouldn’t even say hi. Even in the beginning of the first year in the R.I.C.H
            program I never said a word to anyone, but now I’m not afraid of my shadow. I can say, hello without
            regretting it. I stand up for myself and stand up for my friends as well. I will always believe that I
            MATTER. That is why I Matter is my favorite R.I.C.H principle.
            <br><br>
            Mrs. Barbara Sizemore in your life you used an R.I.C.H principle that helped you in your life. That
            principle is I Matter. I matter helped you believe in yourself and overcome what other people said to you.
            For example, you were fired on job that helped many students stop being a bunch of rude people into
            successful people. After you got fired you didn’t care at all. You went on looking for a job that suits you.
            You believed in yourself on finding a new job that no one will fire you from. Also, when you were in the
            public school system many people talked about you because you were black, but you didn’t care at all you
            ignored them and knew that you mattered.
            <br><br>
            Mrs. Barbara Sizemore, thank you for inspiring me. You inspired me by believing in yourself and not giving
            up on anything. What you did inspired many people including me. You taught me to never give up in what I
            want to do. You are an amazing strong woman that stands up for yourself.
            <br><br>
            Sincerely,<br><br>
            Imani Kirlew<br>

          <h1> Dear Chuck Brown by Christian Hernandez </h1>
          <h4> Spring 2013 </h4>
          <p>
            Dear Chuck Brown,
            <br><br>
            Hello, my name is Christian Hernandez. I go to P.S.155Q on 130th Street/ 115th Avenue. I am 11 years old,
            and I love to do a bunch of things. I love to sing in the choir at church and am energetic. I teach my
            brother how to sing, and I’m trying to learn to play the guitar. You are one of my idols. At the RICH
            Program, we use four different principals: I matter, I am responsible for my behavior, I am considerate of
            my classmates and others, and I use thinking strategies for school and life success.
            <br><br>
            I know a lot about your life. You were born in 1934 in Gaston, North Carolina. Your parents are Lyla Louise
            Brown and Albert Louis Moody. You grew up very poor, and had to stop going to school when you completed the
            seventh grade. You were imprisoned several times for robbery and selling stolen property. In the early
            1950’S, you went to Lorton Reformatory for 8 years. There, you earned your high school diploma, bought your
            first guitar, and learned how to play it. When this happened, you showed that you mattered and you never
            gave up.
            <br><br>
            Soon, you played the guitar in shows. You left prison in the late 50’s. You then married your first wife and
            became a father. You kept on returning to Lorton Reformatory every year for 15 years. Then, you played in
            different bands, and in 1966, you formed your own band called “Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers”. When you
            created your own band, you showed that you were considerate of your fellow band players. A decade later, you
            began to develop your own music, called Go-Go. Years later, you made songs to support Go-Go, with different
            partners like Eva Cassidy and his daughter. Then, when Cassidy died, he dedicated one of his albums to her.
            <br><br>
            I chose you as my leader for different reasons. You worked hard to achieve your goals. You even made your
            own music. To me, you’re incredible. You never gave up, even when times were rough. Even when you were in
            prison, you still learned from your mistakes. You even formed your own band. Forming a band takes a lot of
            work, but you made it seem so easy. This is why I picked you, Chuck Brown.
            <br><br>
            I use the RICH principles to help me in school in different ways. I am using the principle “I matter” by
            knowing and believing that I can do the work that my teacher has given me. I am using the principal “I am
            responsible for my behavior” by choosing between right and wrong. I am using the principle “I am considerate
            of my classmates and others” by helping my friends with their work and caring for them. This is how I am
            using the principles to help me at school.
            <br><br>
            If there was one principle I believe you used to become successful, it was “I matter”. I believe you used
            this principle to help you for different reasons. You did your best to complete your goals. You were
            confident in yourself to do everything you could do. When you went to prison, you learned from your
            mistakes. You loved making music for your fans, and you also liked making a good impression on your fans.
            This is how you used the principle, “I matter”.
            <br><br>
            You inspire me in many ways, Chuck Brown. You make me want to be like you. I want to be a musician, not just
            any musician, but a musician who never gives up. I thank you for inspiring me to be like you. I believe the
            lesson that I learned from you is to never give up. Thank you!
            <br><br>
            Sincerely,<br><br>
            Christian Hernandez<br>

          <h1> Dear Ms. Maya Angelou by Kayla Ashanti Grant </h1>
          <h4> Spring 2013 </h4>
          <p>
            Dear Maya Angelou,
            <br><br>
            Hello! My name is Kayla Ashanti Grant, but everybody calls me Chubby Cheeko or Kaykay. I am ten years old. I
            am in the fifth grade and go to the school at P. S. 155 Q. elementary school. My favorite form of writing is
            poetry. I have been coming to the rich program for the first time for the two semesters. I love coming to
            the rich program. The rich program helps us be ready for school and even life success. It is helping me to
            write a lot better in poetry too!
            <br><br>
            Maya, I chose you because I would love to learn more about your childhood and the ways in life that helped
            you get through all of your struggles. I also want to know how you felt growing up as a kid not speaking at
            all after you thought your words killed somebody. That must have been hard not talking for most of your
            child hood. This sounds like a hard challenge for the people of today because all we want to do is talk.
            <br><br>
            You are a really remarkable woman who inspires young poets today and every day. You were eventually taken to
            your grandmother’s house to spend your life with your brother after your mom’s boyfriend’s death. I would
            also not speak if I thought words from my mouth would kill somebody. I think that is not the way to handle
            it. You should have had more confidence in yourself. This is what the RICH Program teaches us. This program
            teaches us four principles. These principles are: I matter, I will be responsible for my behavior, I will be
            considerate of my classmates and others, and I will use thinking strategies for school and life success.
            <br><br>
            You were born in 1928. The day was April 4th. You were trained to be a dancer, but in earlier days you
            decided to be a poet. After being married to your husband you met many celebrities like Alvin Ailey and Ruth
            Beckford. You are very successful in your work. You are a remarkable woman. In school I use many RICH
            principles.
            <br><br>
            One rich principle I use is I will use thinking strategies for school and life success. I use this principle
            instead of not caring about my school work; I try my best to pass my test with at least a 95%. The principle
            shows you to put in effort and also study hard to get even better scores, or when I want to do well on the
            New York State tests.
            <br><br>
            The second RICH Principle is I will be considerate of my classmates and others. This principle shows you to
            be generous towards all people. You have to be considerate of others to be considerate towards you. I was
            considerate when I helped my friend Yaritza when she had gotten a shot and she was in pain. I helped carry
            her books and more.
            <br><br>
            The third RICH Principle is I will be responsible for my behavior. This means you have to take action for
            what you do. This means you have to control your behavior to be a good person instead of being somebody who
            is negative and rude.
            <br><br>
            The last principle I want to introduce you to is I matter. This means to have respect towards yourself. When
            you told the truth of speaking up for yourself, it showed you matter. When you matter you do not care what
            people say about you or anything. The principle, I matter, is showing you are an independent person like in
            your poem “phenomenal woman”.
            <br><br>
            So Maya, as you can see, you are a very remarkable woman with many talents. You are inspiration to all poets
            around the world. You are a really great poet. Your talent in poetry is really inspiring to me and more
            youthful poets and older poets as well. You use everyday life in your books and pieces of poetry. You are an
            inspiration to my writing in school!
            <br><br>

            Dear Mr. Ray Charles,
            <br><br>
            Essay written by Taj Johnson
            <br><br>
            Hi! MY name is Taj Johnson. I am ten years old and in the fourth grade. I use many of the RICH principles.
            Every time I have a test, I study for it and try to incorporate all the RICH principles into my study
            methods. The week of March 3rd, 2008, I took my New York State Math State Exam. I used “Thinking Strategies
            for School Success” to help me solve the difficult problems on the test and strongly believe that I aced the
            exam!
            <br><br>
            I also use the RICH principles at home. One principle I use everyday is “I am Considerate of My Classmates
            and Others.” At dinner, I always make sure I say a prayer before I eat. I also make sure I do not burp or do
            any nasty things while other people are eating. The same thing applies for breakfast and lunch. I also use
            the RICH principle “Thinking Strategies for School Success” to check my little sister’s homework. I try to
            use strategies to help her get all of her homework correct.
            <br><br>
            I’ve been reading about you and see you play the piano…just like me! In one of your videos you said that you
            never give up. That also ties in to the RICH principle “Thinking Strategies for School Success.” I try to
            find ways not to mess up when I’m playing the piano. Your words really inspire me to never give up! Every
            time I make a mistake, I start all over until I get the whole thing perfect. Now I know it is not about
            getting it perfect but it’s rather about doing your best. Also in one of your videos you said that you
            helped your mother a lot as a child, which ties into the RICH principle, “I am Responsible for my Behavior.”
            Sometimes I would feel bad for saying “no” to my mother when she really needed my help and after
            reading/learning about you, I know to say “yes” whenever she calls on me.
            <br><br>
            Thank you Mr. Ray Charles, for being a visionary…Reading and listening to your visionary pieces encouraged
            and influenced me in so many ways. I know now that it is not about striving for perfection, but doing my
            absolute best in everything I participate in.
            <br><br>
            Sincerely,<br><br>
            Taj J.

            Dear Ossie Davis,
            <br><br>
            Essay written by Nija Woods.
            <br><br>
            Hello my name is Nija W. and first and foremost I would like to let you know how much I appreciate people
            like you. Many people forget to praise the wonderful leaders we’ve had throughout our history. The
            generation today doesn’t acknowledge the fact that if it wasn’t for African Americans like you; we would not
            be able to overcome the things that happen in the world today. Being in the RICH Program has helped me to
            thank God for people like you, Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, Harriet Tubman and the many other
            extraordinary African American activists. You all have fought for freedom in a way that no one may have
            thought you could. You all weren’t physical fighters but mental fighters. You all put the word out that you
            were somebody and would not allow anyone to discourage or persuade you into not believing that. For these
            things I would like to thank you…for allowing me to acknowledge the astonishing things you’ve done for my
            generation.
            <br><br>
            As a student in the RICH Program I am serious about integrating and utilizing our four RICH Principles in my
            daily life. These RICH Principles have helped both inside and outside of school, with my attitude and
            behavior. The RICH Principle that I have been trying to use everyday is “I Matter.” This RICH Principle
            helps me believe in myself at all times so that I, just like you, can become as successful as you one day,
            not with fame and money but with pride and dignity.
            <br><br>
            Another RICH Principle that I have been trying to use daily is “I use Thinking Strategies for School
            Success.” This RICH Principle helps me to plan ahead for life and school related issues. I always try to use
            this RICH Principle so that I can keep track of what I need to do and plan ahead to achieve my goals. I also
            see the ways in which you used the RICH Principle “I use Thinking Strategies for School Success” by planning
            ahead. Although many people may have tried to put you down, their negativity only made you stronger and
            allowed you to dream bigger. You took all the bad criticism and turned it into a source of positive
            influence to help you become the wonderful legend that you are today.
            <br><br>
            The other RICH Principle that I use is “I am Responsible for my Behavior.” The way I have been using this
            RICH Principle is by letting the negative influences turn into positive influences. For example, I just like
            you, have been in a situation in which people may have looked down on me or said some bad things about me.
            I, also like you, learned to keep a positive mind set and once I always know that I matter, no one can ever
            make me feel less than what I am. You have used this RICH Principle in so many ways. One major way you have
            used this RICH Principle that stood out was when you where a little child walking home. As few police
            officers stopped you, not because you did anything wrong but because they wanted to taunt you. They took you
            to the police station and poured syrup on top of your head and laughed at you as you walked out. You went
            home, cleaned yourself up and didn’t bother to try to revolt against them or tell your family because you
            knew those actions would escalate the situation. Many people in your generation may have reacted the same
            way you did, however sadly, those in my generation are more quick tempered and always ready to retaliate.
            <br><br>
            Finally, the other RICH Principle I have been using is “I am Considerate of my Classmates and Others.”
            Although I have just started realizing how important it is to show others respect I have been working extra
            hard applying this Principle. I must admit that being in the RICH Program has helped me to use this RICH
            Principle daily. You have used this Rich Principle all the time whether people treated you with respect or
            not because you knew that two wrongs don’t make a right; just because people don’t treat you with respect
            doesn’t mean you don’t have to treat them with respect.
            <br><br>
            In conclusion, I will like to thank you so much for inspiring me to become a leader and inspiration in my
            community, just like you! I have learned so many things from you and the most important lesson you have
            taught me was to kill people with kindness and you will succeed in life even if no one ever believes in you.
            <br><br>
            Thank you Ossie Davis!!!
            <br><br>
            Sincerely,<br><br>
            Nija Woods.

            Dear Ernie Banks,
            <br><br>
            Essay written by Tyler L.
            <br><br>
            My name is Tyler L.. I attend the RICH program in Jamaica Queens, New York. In this program we take time to
            learn about the RICH principles and how they apply to our everyday life. There are 2 principles that are
            very important to me, “I matter” and “I am responsible for my behavior.” I think these principles also
            relate to you because you were the first National Leaguer to win an MVP award in his consecutive years
            (1958-1959).
            <br><br>
            In the program, we learn about these principles every week. I honestly try to apply them to my life daily. I
            use the principle “I matter” by believing in myself and maintaining a positive attitude. I also use the
            principle “I am responsible for my behavior.” I put forth high levels of effort to do my best. I think we
            have similar goals and from reading and learning bout you, Mr. Banks, I have been inspired. When I
            discovered all of your accomplishments, I used your success to help me alter my attitude about becoming
            successful one day.
            <br><br>
            Mostly, I apply these principles to improve my grades in school. Mr. Banks, you have inspired me to go
            against everything that was wrong and to do the right thing even when the wrong thing seems like the right
            thing to do. You are an influence to many people, specifically baseball players. That is how I know that you
            know you matter. Mr. Banks you also took some advice from a wonderful baseball player, Jackie Robinson. Even
            though there was segregation against black men you still were a Visionary Leader. Mr. Robinson once told you
            to listen to others and be considerate. I think that has helped you to become who you are today.
            <br><br>
            Thank you Mr. Banks for everything you have done for our race. You may have not realized this at the time
            but you really inspired me. The most important thing that I think you accomplished was overcoming racism and
            segregation as a young black athlete. You have really taught me a valuable lesson about achieving my goals.
            Many people, including myself, love the things you did. Congratulations, Mr. Banks!
            <br><br>
            Sincerely,<br><br>

          <h4> Spring 2012 </h4>
          <p>
            Dear Maya Angelou,
            <br><br>
            Essay written by Chrisann A.
            <br><br>
            My name is Chrisann and I am a RICH student. I have been learning about RICH principles and using them in my
            everyday life. The RICH principle I find most important is “I Matter.” I find that particular RICH principle
            to be outstanding from all the other RICH principles because “I Matter” can mean a lot of things like always
            remembering to put me first and believing in myself
            <br><br>
            I am using “I Matter” in school and at home by keeping a positive attitude in school and showing that I want
            to achieve great things in life and be successful. At home I am showing that “I Matter” by respecting my
            parents and also showing that I am thankful to have supportive and awesome parents.
            <br><br>
            Dr. Angelou you have done a lot of great things in your life. What I admire about you, Dr. Angelou, is that
            you always practiced self confidence. Growing up, people would say that you would never be anything. Instead
            you chose not to listen to the side and focused on all the positive things that encouraged you. You chose to
            use that negative energy to build you up which in turn helped you become the successful woman you are today!
            <br><br>
            The words I would use to describe you Dr. Angelou are determined, self confident and strong. I think you are
            a very determined individual and when I was reading your biography it talked about how committed you were to
            learn how to read. In learning how to read you grew to love going to the library and writing. This
            experience opened up your mind to a world of imagination. I also think you are self confident because to
            become a poet you have to believe in your work and believe that you can do it when no one else understands
            your vision. Having self confidence and belief that you can do anything you put your mind to is so important
            for me to understand because I someday would like to be very successful just like you!
            <br><br>
            Dr. Maya Angelou, you have been an inspiration to me because I have learned a lot of life lesson from
            reading about you. One life lesson I learned was that “It doesn’t matter what color or gender you are
            because you can be anything want to be.”
            <br><br>
            I thank you Dr. Angelou for your hard work and continuous effort to opening up peoples’ minds and showing my
            generation that passion and knowing that you “Matter” opens up a world of endless possibilities.
            <br><br>
            Sincerely,
            <br><br>

            Dear Ms. Carroll,
            <br><br>
            Essay written by Abigail N.
            <br><br>
            Hello my name is Abigail Nelson I have chosen to write my National Visionary Leader Essay about you because
            you have inspired me a lot. You worked so hard to become an actress and you were the first black women to
            star in a network television series. Although I don’t want to be an actress, I do want to be the best that I
            can at my profession. To become successful in your profession you didn’t take “no” for an answer and you
            strived for the best. Over the past couple months I’ve been in this program called Reach Into Cultural
            Heights; it has taught me many things, but the best thing about this program are the 4 principles. At the
            start of the program I learned the RICH principles and they are: I matter, I am responsible for my behavior,
            I am considerate of my classmates, and I use thinking strategies for school success. Almost everyday of my
            life I use each principle at school, and at home. And when I start working I will still need to use the RICH
            principles.
            <br><br>
            The RICH principles I think you used throughout your life are, I matter and I am responsible for my
            behavior. When growing up, you took your mothers advice on how to conduct yourself when acting. Your mother
            told you “When you’re forgiven, it makes you understand just how much you are loved. And when you forgive,
            the whole world opens up to you and you make yourself available to the highest form of happiness.” Also, you
            took music and acting lessons to become as good as you are now at your craft. By knowing that you mattered,
            you were determined and confident when auditioning for a role, and you still continue to break new grounds
            in the entertainment world.
            <br><br>
            As a RICH student I inspire my friends and family members on how to use the RICH principles in new ways. I
            explained each principle to them. Starting with I matter, which means to believe in yourself, have a
            positive attitude, and have a high self esteem. Next is I am responsible for my behavior, this principle
            means knowing when you did something wrong, having self control, and being respectful. I also told them
            stories about how I used these principles. One of the stories I told them was when I spilled red paint on my
            mother’s yellow mat and tried to cover it up wit yellow paint. When she went to wash the yellow mat the red
            paint washed away, so she asked me what happen to her carpet and I told her it was my entire fault. She
            wasn’t angry but was happy that I was honest with her. Then I explained the next principle which is, I am
            considerate of my classmates and others. This means being helpful, being appreciative, and being generous.
            Finally I explained the last principle which is, I use thinking strategies for school success. This
            principle means taking action, asking for help to do better, and making improvements.
            <br><br>
            These RICH principles helped me become a better person. They helped me stop being disrespectful, helped me
            focus more on my school work, encouraging me to never give up and work towards getting good grades. Thank
            you, Diahann Carroll for inspiring me with your success story. From your success story you taught me to
            continue to be determined, and focused on achieving my goals. I know that my road to success will not be
            easy but I am up for the challenge.
            <br><br>

            Essay written by Ricardo Headley
            <br><br>
            Dear William “Bill” Russell,
            <br><br>
            My name is Ricardo Headley and it is a privilege and an honor to talk to a basketball legend like you. I am
            a fourteen-year-old teenage boy and I attend the RICH Peer Leadership program.
            <br><br>
            Mr. Russell, I believe that we share many common features such as our date of birth; when you were my age I
            had the same facial feature as you; I play the same sport that you played in youth ages (not to call old);
            you had patience and endurance even though people treated you like you were nothing.
            <br><br>
            Here at the Rich program I have been learning about 4 main principles that keep me in check and they are: I
            matter, I am responsible for behavior, I am considerate of others, and I use thinking strategies for life
            success.
            <br><br>
            I use I matter to have a high self-esteem but not by being conceited, plus this RICH principle constantly
            reminds me that I have a purpose. I use I am responsible for my behavior to show that I have control over
            myself and also to show that I am different from the others.
            <br><br>
            I use I am considerate of others to show that I am not self-absorbed and also to show that life is not
            always about yourself but, also about the people you care for and cherish. I use thinking strategies for
            life success to properly plan my life and always strive for a higher position in life.
            <br><br>
            I believe that you used these 4 main principles throughout your lifetime. In my opinion, I believe that you
            used these principles to keep your life on the right track. I matter because you never doubted yourself; I
            am responsible for my behavior because even though there was racism you stayed on your course instead of
            retaliating and I use thinking strategies for life success because you thought of plans that were effective
            on the basketball court.
            <br><br>
            What I learned from you Mr. Russell is to have patience and even though people will do you wrong and hurt
            you, you hurt them with patience because it takes strength to be the bigger person and not retaliate. I
            would like to thank you, a true basketball legend, William “Bill” Russell for showing me that I can achieve
            anything so long ask I work hard and am diligent.
            <br><br>
            Sincerely,
            <br><br>

            Essay written by Andre C.
            <br><br>
            Hi, my name is Justice Williams. The reason I chose this person was because he was a jazz bassist. I am a
            saxophone player so William Betts and I are not really that different. He was born on July 22, 1928 and died
            on August 6, 2006. He has used many of the RICH principles in his life, without even knowing what a RICH
            principle is! He has used the RICH principles by staying positive and practicing hard so he could achieve
            his goals.
            <br><br>
            One day, William’s mother sent him to the store to get groceries, and on the way there, he saw a marching
            band. He followed the marching band all the way around town. When he saw the band, it inspired him to play
            the percussion but when he got home, he was scolded. He told his mother he wanted to be a percussionist.
            That is how he got into music. When he was a child he was into band music but as he grew up, he got into
            jazz.
            <br><br>
            When William grew up, he had to balance his music career and family life. He didn’t have any brothers or
            sisters, but he did have a wife and kids. He was just a normal person like you with a special talent that
            made him very successful.
            <br><br>
            In high school, William Betts met Milt Hilton and that is how he decided to be a bassist. When he met Milt
            Hilton, he was inspired to play the bass. Meeting a famous jazz bassist made him want play the bass instead
            of percussion. He worked very hard to get where he was. He could never stop practicing.
            <br><br>
            William Betts has inspired me in many ways, even though many of you didn’t know who he was before this
            report. He has used the RICH principle I matter and I am responsible for my behavior. I would thank him but
            he isn’t alive anymore. He knows that he lived a full and successful life.
            <br><br>
            When I grow up, I will probably play in a jazz band just like William Betts. He has told me that I can be
            anything I want to be even more than other people. Other people tell me I can do anything, William Betts has
            actually showed me that I can do anything.
            <br><br>
            Sincerely,
            <br><br>
            Justice W.<br>
