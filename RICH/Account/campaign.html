                    <p class="paragraph"><b>I matter</b>. This is the main RICH principle that kind of sums up everything else. Ultimately, once an individual understands their importance, they're able to really go out in the world and accomplish
                      their goals and learn how to be compassionate towards others. So, whenever you think about quitting or giving up, just always understand that you matter. It's really being your authentic self and expressing who you are. Don't
                      hide behind the mask, be uniquely you. </p>

                        to improve whatever issue we had. Through that, I gained a lot of confidence in what I had to say. Everyone has something important to say. So, never feel like what you have to say is less than anyone else. I have confidence
                        so now I make eye contact, project my voice, and really understand how to be successful inside and outside of the classrooms. It's been a long journey, but I'm here. I'm achieving my goals. </p>

                                throughout my life. My roots are solid and founded on the Guiding Principles, and I’m passing them down to my children, so they may show up in the world as loving, respectable, accountable and amazing human beings.

                                  <p class="paragraph">I lived by those four principles my entire life. They deal with all the aspects that someone needs to be successful in life. I was hired as a professional model on my first shot and I think a lot
                                    of that just had to do with the way I carried myself. These principles allowed me to be confident under any circumstances. No matter how high the level of competition was, I remained confident. My self-confidence
                                    really helped me and that was all due to the RICH program; RICH invested in me and I invested in myself. </p>

                                        <p class="paragraph"><b>I matter</b> because without this principle, I wouldn’t have a lot of confidence; I had very low self-esteem. The <b>I matter</b> principle was definitely a confidence booster for

                                          <p class="paragraph">The most helpful activity was roleplaying, where we would act out real-life scenarios using the 4 Guiding Principles. This helped me better understand what they were and what they
                                            meant. It was really my favorite activity because we got to use our creative minds to see our version of what the principles look like in the real world and outside of everything. For current and
                                            incoming RICH students, I would just say to use those principles everywhere you go because you will always remember them at the end of the day. Just remember that you matter. </p>
